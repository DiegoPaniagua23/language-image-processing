# Homework 02: Deep Learning Architectures

This assignment extends the Language & Image Processing course into deep learning approaches for text and images. The current deliverable is a written report that synthesizes the theoretical foundations and practical considerations discussed in class.

## Assignment Overview

- Review convolutional neural networks for computer vision pipelines
- Study recurrent and attention-based models for sequence modeling
- Connect Transformer components (self-attention, positional encodings, transfer learning)
- Discuss optimization, regularization, and fine-tuning strategies for deep models

## Deliverables

- `submission/Tarea 2 NLP.pdf`: Consolidated report with answers and illustrative examples

Future updates may include notebooks or code experiments as additional coursework is assigned.
